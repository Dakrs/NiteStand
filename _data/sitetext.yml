history:
  titleText: "Our Mission"
  text: "As a group of young people who have a very active night life and a background in computer science and engineering, we began to take notice of how most nocturnal establishments have a decayed maner of operating. As the end of the night approaches, we find ourselves trapped in an everlasting queue of people that are all trying to pay and head home. Since everyone is eager to leave, we often witness a display of violent behaviours, with people pushing and swearing, leaving us feeling  unsafe. Through the pains we suffered, as consumers, we found an opportunity of business that could solve our problems. By turning nocturnal establishments digital, we could eliminate consumer’s pains and help the business."

mission:
  text:
    - para: "A felicidade está nos pequenos momentos vividos com as pessoas que mais gostamos. Os sorrisos, as gargalhadas, as danças e até mesmo as canções fazem com que nos sintamos mais vivos que nunca. A batida de uma música no ouvido, a sincronização do batimento do coração e aquela troca de olhares sorrateira explodem as nossas sensações e impedem-nos de dizer que não aos momentos. O Nite é conforto, é segurança, é alegria, é, na verdade, o momento. É a razão para que nenhum destes momentos seja perdida. É a resposta às preocupações quando as pessoas saem à noite."
    - para: "Seremos um sinónimo que tudo correrá bem, que as pessoas se podem divertir que, nós, tratamos do resto. Permitiremos aos nossos consumidores aproveitar o agora e deixar os problemas de lado. Lembrá-los-emos dos amigos e prometeremos que um sorriso nunca mais será o mesmo."
    - para: "Seremos uma referência, um símbolo de segurança e o sexto sentido para que boas coisas aconteçam, em qualquer estabelecimento e em qual lugar."

  title: "Before we start"
  text: "The following sections present a short walkthrought of how our system connect each of its components and the tasks played out by each actor. A staff member is an establishment's employee, a manager is the owner or the establishment's manager and finally the customer is an establishment's client."

walkthroughtpart1:
  title: "1. Choosing a menu for the night"
  text: "The first task our system requires is filling out a menu. This constains the current list of items sold by an establishment. A manager logs on into his account, creates a menu and fills out its products."

walkthroughtpart2:
  title: "2. Card Activation"
  text: "Every consumer of an establishment receives a card at the entrance. This card is used to buy products inside of the space. An employee activates the card using the staff application and gives it to the client which then enters inside the establishment."

walkthroughtpart3:
  title: "3. Card Sync"
  text: "At this point, a client is inside the establishment and may consume as he wishes. Althrought this task is not needed, if an user wants to take advantage of our features, he must link his card to his account in our platform. To do so, an user opens up our costumer application, logs in and approaches the card near his phone. Our application will read the card number and complete the synchronization. After this point, all our user's features are available."

walkthroughtpart4:
  title: "4. Product Selling"
  text: "Whenever a customer wants a product, he goes to one of the bar employees and asks for it. The bartender takes the user's card, scans it with the staff app and chooses the item to purchase. The item is automatically added to the costumer's card. With costumer's app, an user is able to view the content of his card."

  text: "After a user pays his card, he may want to leave at any time. To do so, he moves to the exit of the space and gives his card to the employee controlling the exits. This staff members scan the card in his app and verifies if it has already been paid. After that, the user exits the establishment."
