history:
  titleText: "Our Mission"
  text: "As a group of young people who have a very active night life and a background in computer science and engineering, we began to take notice of how most nocturnal establishments have a decayed manner of operating. As the end of the night approaches, we find ourselves trapped in an everlasting queue of people that are all trying to pay and head home. Since everyone is eager to leave, we often witness a display of violent behaviours, with people pushing and swearing, leaving us feeling  unsafe. Through the pains we suffered, as consumers, we found an opportunity of business that could solve our problems. By turning nocturnal establishments digital, we could eliminate consumer’s pains and help the business."

mission:
  text:
    - para: "Happiness is in the little moments we spend with the people we love most. Smiles, laughter, and dancing to the best songs is what makes us feel alive. A song playing in sync with the beating of your heart, or a sneaky look in the eyes that induces a burst emotions and forbids saying no to one of these moments."
    - para: "As long as we are part of your life, you can fully enjoy your night out and trust that everything will be alright. We allow our consumers to live and enjoy the now, leaving aside all the worries. We will remind you of your friends and we’ll make sure your smile is never the same."
    - para: "We will be a reference, a token of security and the sixth sense for good things happening, anywhere and any time."

walkthroughtintro:
  title: "Before we start"
  text: "The following sections present a short walkthrough of how our system connects each of its components and the tasks played out by each actor. A staff member is an establishment's employee, a manager is the owner or the establishment's manager and, finally, the consumer is an establishment's client."

walkthroughtpart1:
  title: "1. Choosing a menu for the night"
  text: "The first task our system requires is filling out a menu. This contains the current list of items sold by an establishment. A manager logs in, creates a menu and fills out its products."
  img: "/assets/img/manager/menu.png"
  imgcaption: "Fig.1: Manager Website - Menu Management"


walkthroughtpart2:
  title: "2. Card Activation"
  text: "Every consumer of an establishment receives a card at the entrance. This card is used to buy products inside of the space. An employee activates the card using the staff application and gives it to the client, who then enters the establishment."
  img: "/assets/img/staff/activatesearch.png"
  imgcaption: "Fig.2: Staff App - Card Activation"

walkthroughtpart3:
  title: "3. Card Sync"
  text: "At this point, the client is inside the establishment and may consume as they wish. Although this task is not required, if a user wants to take advantage of our features, they must link their card to their account in our platform. To do so, a user opens up our consumer application, logs in and approaches the card near their phone. Our application will read the card number and complete the synchronization. After this point, all the user's features are available."
  img: "/assets/img/userswithout/screennocard.png"
  imgcaption: "Fig.3: Consumers App - Card Synchronization"

walkthroughtpart4:
  title: "4. Product Selling"
  text: "Whenever a consumer wants a product, they go to one of the bar employees and ask for it. The bartender takes the user's card, scans it with the staff app and chooses the requested item. The item is automatically added to the costumer's card. With the costumer's app, a user is able to view the content of their card."
  img: "/assets/img/staff/cardapio.png"
  imgcaption: "Fig.4: Staff App - Product Sale"

walkthroughtpart5:
  title: "5. User's Payment"
  text: "At any time, a user may pay their bill using the consumer's application. They just open the app, consult the bill, choose a payment method and pay."
  img: "/assets/img/userswithout/billinginfo.png"
  imgcaption: "Fig.5: User App - User's Payment"

walkthroughtpart6:
  title: "6. Payment Control"
  text: "After a user pays their card, they can leave at any time. To do so, they go to the exit of the space and give their card to the employee controlling the exits. This staff member scans the card in their app and verifies if it has been paid. After that, the user exits the establishment."
